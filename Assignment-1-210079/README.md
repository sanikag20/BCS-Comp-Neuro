<b><h2><u>My Conclusions:</u></b><br>

There were 1869 customers out of 7044 who left their telecom service. Some of the points I found that could help in lowering this number are :-

1. From the DataSet, I found that there were 3 ways of payment in the contract of different telecom companies, i.e. yearly, biannually and a month-to-month basis contract. I also found that around 88.55% of the customers who left their telecom service (churned) were paying with a month-to-month contract.
<br><br> Therefore, I believe that a annual and biannual plan of service would be more beneficial for the companies with respect the preventing churning.
<br><br><br>
2. I also concluded from the Dataset the services like technical support, online backup, online security played an important role in keeping customers from churning. Most of the customers who churned for a service were not being benefitted with these benefits.<br>
Example: 
<br>(i) About 77.37% of the customers who churned from a telecom service weren't getting technical support from the same.
<br> (ii) Also, 65.97% of the customers who churned were not getting online backup and 78.17% of the same category of customers didn't had any online security provided.
<br><br>
From these percentage, I can say that services that ease the customer, like these three, play a major role in the matter of churning, and therefore must be provided by the companies.
<br><br>
3. I also found that among the different ways in which customers paid their charges, i.e. electronic check, mailed check, bank transfer, credit card, most of the customers who left their service providers were paying through electronic check. Therefore, companies could try and avoid this payment method as it would seem from that customers face difficulties while paying from this method and hence churn. About 57.30% of the churning customers were paying through electronic check.
<br><br>
4. Also, 64.79% of the customers in the churning category didn't get a device protection scheme from their provider. This shows that majority of the customers while getting a telecom service look for a device protection scheme to have a long term run with the provider.
<br><br>
5. Oddly enough, about 74.91% of the churning category were having a paperless billing system. This shows that customers preferred having a written bill over an e-bill. So, companies instead of spending more on providing e-bill, could use post-offices and other ways to provide a written bill to customers.
<br><br>
6. Also, those customers who had an internet service preferred DSL over Fiber Optic as 69.40% of the churning customers used Fiber Optic for Internet Services. Therefore, I intrepret that DSL provide a better internet service than Fiber Optic cable, so companies who plan to provide internet connections should prefer using DSL over Fiber Optic.
<br><br>
7. I found that the maximum tenure for any company was 72, and cusotmers who could surpass the period of 0 to 9 tenure stayed with their service providers generally.So, companies need to make sure to apply schemes (as mentioned in the above points), to make the customer stay for atleat a period of 10 tenure.
<br><br>
The same goes for Monthly Charges. The maximum Monthly Charge paid by a customer in the data was 118.75/-. <br>
The companies who asked for Monthly Charges in the range of 70/- to 110/- had a risk of high churning than others. Hence, Companies should try to keep themselves away from this range of charge.
